# Good issue practices

It is often difficult to get your problem across effectively when writing an issue. We implemented templates into the repository to help with this. However, if you are new to creating issues we still advise that you read through this list of best practices. Conforming to these will help developers have a deeper understanding of the issue, which in turn will make it much easier to work on it (resulting in a faster resolution).

:::info
Some issues have been tagged with *good first issue*. If you are particularly struggling with creating an issue, these can be a helpful starting point. Note that you can filter by label to see only these issues:

## Make sure the issue does not already exist

Use the search bar on the [issues page](https://github.com/ejh243/BrainFANS/issues) to check if any of the open issues relate to your own. Sometimes a bug or enhancement has already been filed and a discussion is already taking place.

If you send in a repeat issue, *don't worry*, we will close the issue and provide you with links to any related issues that already exist.

## Keep your title short

We appreciate that this can be difficult, especially with documentation faults and bugs. Please save your words for the description, a long detailed title is not very useful.

## Be clear and concise

Give us all of the important information in a clear and concise way. If our developers are having a difficult time understanding your issue, they will likely need to contact you for clarification. By being clear and concise, you save both the developer's and your own time.

## Give us steps to reproduce bugs in bug templates

Bugs can be difficult to reproduce on different machines and systems. Giving us a step by step guide of how the bug occurred or specifically how to recreate it will speed up the time it takes to resolve the issue substantially. If you are unable to recall such steps, please give us any relevant information. Log file dumps can also be useful as they enable the developer to confirm if they have reproduced the bug.

## Be respectful

Sometimes issues take a long time to resolve. If you think we are taking too long (or you have more to say after submission), please continue the conversation in the comments section of the issue. Good communication is the main driver towards getting your issue resolved.
