# Creating an issue

Creating issues is the best way to help with the growth of the BrainFANS repository. Issues are a great way of notifying us about problems with the pipelines and scripts. They also help us with documenting the changes that have been made to the repository over time. Your contributions mean a lot to the developers.

To create an issue, follow the steps below:

## Open the issues tab on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/ejh243/BrainFANS)

## Click 'New issue'

## Select the relevant template for your report

Your issue could come under a variety of different categories. To help with this, we have created many templates that will help with structuring your issue. If you think none of these templates apply to your specific query/problem, you also have the opportunity to choose a blank template.

Descriptions for the different templates we offer are given below:

* Bug: Make a report for any bugs you have encountered in the repository (*i.e.* Unexpected/unwanted behaviour)
* Code refactor: Make suggestions for how code can be optimised or improved
* Documentation: Report any faults in the documentation (outdated pages, spelling errors, page suggestions *etc.*)
* Enhancement: Suggest any features that should be added/altered (to the pipelines or repository as a whole)

## Fill in the issue report

Use the boxes provided to explain the particular issue you have. For you first issue, we recommend checking out the [next page](./Good-issue-practices.md).

## Assign relevant tags (if applicable)

IF you have permissions to do so, add relevant personnel to the assignees section (assignees will be notified of the issue upon creation). If you are planning to address the issue yourself, remember to assign yourself.  You can also add further labels to the issue if they are relevant (obvious labels related to the type of issue template you have selected will be added for you).

If you do not have the permissions to do this, one of the admins will do this for you.
