With an issue chosen, you will need to determine the scope of your changes. Please refer to the section below that best describes the scope of your issue.

Simply click next at the bottom of this page, you can start with the contribution process straight away.

## Larger scope

This covers issues that require:

For projects of this scope we reccommend you run the website locally before pushing any of your commits. To learn how to do this, you can visit [**this page**].
