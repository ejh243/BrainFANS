# Step 3: Making your changes

The pages for this website can be found in the directory: `/documentation/docs`. Pages are generally organised with the same names as what is seen in the search bar in your web browser. For example, this page can be found in `documentation/docs/Developer-information/Contributing-to-documentation/Making-your-changes`.  

:::danger[Reserved keywords]
Due to the way docusaurus is generating html files from markdown files, there are a few reserved keywords that can break the site if used incorrectly (*i.e.* used in normal sentences). These keywords are **case sensitive** and are only accounted for if they are the **first** word on a line (**not** if they appear in the middle of a sentence). 

Common keywords include:

```
export
import
const
Lines beginning with @
Lines beginning with }, {, ), (
```

## Simple changes to existing pages

Most pages on this website are written in markdown (if you are not familiar with markdown please refer to this [popular guide](https://www.markdowntutorial.com)), making it easy to contribute to the documentation. Markdown pages are automatically converted to html files by docusaurus at build time.

If the changes you plan to make are simply making changes to existing pages, then you can make your changes, commit them and follow the rest of the guide for how to contribute to the repository given [on these pages](/Developer-information/Contributing-to-repository/Resolving-the-issue.md). The next steps (pull request, merging *etc.* are the same here as they are there).

## Adding new files

If you are adding new pages to the website please follow the current directory structure so that we can keep the wiki organised. Currently, you will see that the wiki is split into two main directories (Developer information and User information). These directories contain the markdown files that are converted to html files at build time. Subdirectories of these two show up on the left hand side of the webpages in exactly the way one would expect. If you are unsure on where to place your files, ask on GitHub (either on the issue you are working on, or in the [discussions page](https://github.com/ejh243/BrainFANS/discussions/categories/q-a)).

### Markdown metadata

If you take a look at the head of any existing file you will see metadata like the following:

```markdown title="A-markdown-file.md"
---
sidebar_position: position-in-the-sidebar
title: "Name of the page"
description: "Desciption shows up on directory landing page"
---
```

These lines are not a requirement, but adding them allows the pages to be ordered and easily identified. The `sidebar_position` is the most important line of metadata for organisational purposes. You can also specify the `slug` of the web page in the metadata if you wish (be careful with duplicate names of pages if using this feature). 

:::tip[Special features]
Docusaurus has extra features thanks to mdx which can help with page customisation (for example: this tip box). Go to the [next page](./Docusaurus-features.md) to learn more about these features.

## Adding new directories

If you are creating entirely new directories, please include a `_category_.json` file into the new directory. These help with organising the directories in the navbar on the left hand side of the website.

In general, one can use the following as a template for this file:

```json title="_category_.json"
{
  "label": "Name that appears on sidebar",
  "position": position-in-the-sidebar,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "description": "Description that succeeds the title on the directory landing page"
  }
}
```

For more information on this file, you can consult the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated#category-item-metadata).

## Adding images

In order to put images onto your pages you need to upload the file into `/documentation/static`. Ideally put these images into a new directory or a directory that exists already to help with file organisation. 

### Referencing the images in markdown

Docusaurus knows where to look for images by default so you only need to provide the path to the image starting at `static` like so:

```markdown
# The name of the image link will show if the image is not loaded
# for some reason
![name of image link](/img/dna.ico)
```
![name of image link](/img/dna.ico)

## Next steps

The next set of pages are purely for further information about the website. If these do not apply to the issue you are resolving, you can safely ignore them.

The rest of the contribution process follows in the same steps lined out in the regular contribution guide. Please follow the steps outlined [**here**](/Developer-information/Contributing-to-repository/Resolving-the-issue.md) to continue with contributing.
