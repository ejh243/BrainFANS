# Step 1: Choosing an issue

Before making any contributions to the BrainFANS repository, you need to choose which [issue](https://github.com/ejh243/BrainFANS/issues) you aim to resolve.

We recommend doing this so that your pull request (at the end of this guide) is easier to process, and therefore more likely to be accepted. It also helps us with documenting how the repository is changing over time.

:::note
Note that you can [**create your own issue**](/User-information/Creating_issues/Creating-an-issue.md), if you already have an idea in mind. Please still check the open issues first to ensure issues are not duplicated.
:::

Once you have chosen an issue, assign yourself (or ask to be assigned) to the issue. This is required for two reasons:

* You will be notified whenever any comments are made on the issue page, keeping you up to date
* It means other developers know that the issue is being worked on and who to contact for updates on progress

If you are able to assign yourself you can do so by clicking on this button and selecting yourself:

If you are not able to assign yourself, please ask in the comments of the issue thread.

Now you have selected an issue, you can start working on it. Click on the 'next' button to head over to step 2.
