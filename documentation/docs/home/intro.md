# Welcome to the BrainFANS repository

Welcome to the documentation website for our comprehensive repository of processing pipelines for regulatory genomic data including SNP array, dna modifications and ChIP/ATAC-Seq. This website serves as a gateway to access detailed information for those that want to either *use* or *contribute* to the development of these pipelines.

Our objective with this repository was to:

* Enable automated pre-processing of large 'omics data on high-performance computing systems
* Facilitate standardized pre-processing of 'omics data across projects
* Document analyses performed as part of multifaceted brain cell-specific 'omic projects

These pipelines had been developed by the Complex Disease Epigenomics Group at the University of Exeter. While our primary focus is on establishing standardized processes for projects within our group, our repository represents a valuable resource for researchers aiming to delve into the molecular underpinnings of complex phenotypes such as schizophrenia and autism.
