# Welcome to the BrainFANS wiki

Welcome to the documentation website for our comprehensive repository of genomic, regulatory, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data from human brain tissue. Our repository represents a valuable resource for researchers aiming to delve into the molecular underpinnings of complex neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and autism. Through the utilization of advanced methodologies, including fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS), we have curated a rich collection of data from both developing and adult human brains. 

This website serves as a gateway to access detailed information about the analysis pipelines designed for high-performance computing systems, how to contribute and recordings of the analysis that is completed/underway.
